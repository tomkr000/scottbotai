If you’re willing to go to the wrong side of Market,  Mikkeller is great and impressive for anyone who hasn’t  seen it  
For chill vibes and secret neighborhood spot points,  Garaje is great. Solid food and solid beers  
Zero Zero is old school by now but still rad. And Local  Kitchen is really good if you want to go slightly fancier  and also contribute to a long-standing con  
Tell the owner you know me and he’ll either shit his pants  or comp you

My company  collectively does nothing, and I’ve realized JD to price  salary is all that matters. The game is understanding  stupid verbiage. I budgeted my current job, and my offer  was $20k less. I had to go nuclear to get back $15k of it  in 6 mos, and it was like they did me a favor. The rage is  strong.

Is Malort butt chug friendly? Better yet, can someone  
punt it into my butt? 
scotty.madsen@gmail.com 
What is Malort?! 
Will Dalton 
It’s a Chicago liquor. I’ve heard it described as tasting like  
a mix of grapefruit and gasoline. Taylen ran me through  
many of their slogans, but one is that it will make you  
want to fight your dad  
scotty.madsen@gmail.com 
Sounds like something to start drinking early in the day  
for sure then!

Punt butt chugging is new this year but given my history  
of field goal kicks I’m willing to give it a shot!

I’m thinking Saints over bird team 6-3 
Lutz will score all 9 points after kicking a doink that goes  
through the opposite goal posts  
I’m just hoping Hill has -400 points so I’m a genius 
Will Dalton 
I’m hoping the rest of the half is just one long play where  
both teams just keep turning the ball over

It seems Scott forgot to start a bunch of dead dudes so  
that I could make the playoffs with his loss and outscoring  
him by 50 points  
scotty.madsen@gmail.com 
I was thinking that!

It’s not too late to bench Herbert and D Hop in favor of Eli  
and Victor Cruz

I don’t think divisions matter at all for seeding. Top 2 in  
the league get a bye

I don’t understand what’s going on. These Vikings are  
breaking my brain

You’ll get it when Kirk Cousins dies and Dante Culpepper  
can’t quite pull off a comeback in the first round of the  
playoffs

Yeah this is all just buildup for an even bigger  
disappointment  
That’s the Vikings way. Always outdoing themselves

I'm putting on a clinic for how to get 5th place, even with  
a super strong team, and also keep it interesting

If you pull off 5th place, there’s zero doubt in a higher  
power.

Is it making anyone else nervous that the Vikings made  
that kick? We might have veered into a very strange  
timeline

Nah this is what they do. The more they make in the  
regular season, the higher probability they miss a critical  
one in playoffs. See: Gary Anderson
